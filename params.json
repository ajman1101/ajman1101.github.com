I have a passion and drive for games, the industry, and all its facets. In my first year of my college, I joined Computer Science House, which has pushed me to think about how games are made, and how that can be improved. I want to release my games on github. This is a great experiment for all those interested in the game, giving me feedback,from all those interested in the game,as fans, peers, or codemonkeys. I have also learned of \"the open source way\" from FOSS@RIT, the center of open source development on RIT's campus. This has brought me to github and lead me to use it as my version control. Check out my repos, you might find something you like!","tagline":"The name's AJ.....just AJ"}
