Currently I am in Rochester Institutue of Technology's Game Design & Development program, where I am a (almost) 3nd year. I like to spend my free time playing any time of game with my friends or making games for fun. I love to try and break things and hope to do this one day in my job.\r\n\r\n[Check out my Blog!](www.andrewmandula.wordpress.com)","name":"Ajman1101"}
